It's been over a year since I last created a blog post entry, it was because this past year was the most busy, exciting and learning phase of my life. On 16th May 2015 I was [officially made](http://blog.discourse.org/2015/05/welcome-arpit-jalan-to-the-discourse-team/) the part of Discourse team.

I started taking interest into Discourse around January 2014, when I started reading [Jeff Atwood's](http://blog.codinghorror.com/about-me/) blog posts, specially the [Magpie Developer](http://blog.codinghorror.com/the-magpie-developer/) and [Why Ruby](http://blog.codinghorror.com/why-ruby/). More on that [here](http://blog.techapj.com/coding-pleasure/).

Ever since after that I found myself tinkering with Discourse. I was learning Ruby/Rails simultaneously and the Discourse source code was a huge help. I installed Discourse on Digital Ocean and found that the process was a bit tricky so I created a beginners Discourse installation guide and posted that on [meta](https://meta.discourse.org/). That is how I came into notice of Jeff Atwood.

When I asked for an opportunity to work at Discourse in April 2014, I promised Jeff Atwood that I will work like [Rudy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudy_Ruettiger) in his team. He trusted me and gave me an opportunity to work as an Intern with Discourse team.

When I started working at Discourse I didn't had the sufficient Ruby/Rails/EmberJS knowledge but the team was supportive and motivational. I was working under the guidance of Jeff Atwood and he used to take the pressure off me by motivating me and appreciating my work.

I feel fortunate to call Jeff Atwood as my Coach. He gave me an opportunity to follow my passion and made me a better programmer than I was a year ago.

I always wondered what it will be like when I will meet him in person and I got that opportunity at Discourse World Meeting October 2015 in Sydney, Australia. My first reaction was: *I have never met a person as humble as Jeff Atwood*. It never felt like I am talking to a person who co-founded Stack Overflow in 2008 and now Discourse.

Meeting Discourse team in Sydney was an awesome experience, and talking to my coach in person was the proudest moment of my life. It was like a dream come true!

The most emotional moment was when my coach gifted me a signed Rudy Jersey in front of the whole team. I can't explain the adrenaline rush I had at that very moment. It was like receiving a trophy!

I still remember the first time I watched [Rudy movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudy_(film)), it filled me with immense motivation. I learned from Rudy that passion and persistence is the key to success.

Coach, I will never be able to repay your debt and will forever be grateful.
