One month ago on this very day, I joined [Discourse](http://www.discourse.org/) as Programming Intern. Without any doubt, I can say that it was the happiest day of my life. I never had any remote work experience prior to Discourse, and I was bit worried about how it will turn out for me.

On my first day, I was invited into Discourse chat room by [Jeff Atwood](https://twitter.com/codinghorror). For me that moment was like entering Discourse Headquarters. I can feel the sense of excitement and adrenaline rush. It felt great, everyone was so nice and welcoming, I felt like I was at second home. At that moment I knew, this is gonna be amazing!

Being from India the hardest thing for me was to find a job at organization which gives code quality and work culture priority, rather than financial motives. After finding out about Discourse, I knew this is exactly the kind of  organization, I want to work at.

Discourse is the 100% open source discussion platform built for the next decade of the Internet. It is one of the largest open source Ember.js project. The best thing about Discourse is that remote work is in its DNA. The entire Discourse team is distributed across the globe. This means that at almost any time, at least one of the team member will be working from some part around the world.

For me remote work has turned out to be an awesome experience. I can work from my home as per my schedule with flexible timings. The chat room is always healthy and productive, and whenever I face any problem, one of the team member is always available to solve the problem.

IMHO, remote work is a blessing for people like me, living in underprivileged parts of the world. I get to work with the best people in the industry, and at the same time work my way up to relocate in better parts of the world.

I can't speak for all the organizations, but my experience with Discourse has been extra ordinarily wonderful so far. Discourse has become a family for me and every one in the team treats me like a family member. I can't ask for anything more.

When I [turned 24](http://blog.techapj.com/24-birthday), I wrote that how at each Birthday I felt that I am not where I am supposed to be. On this Birthday, I am sure I will be feeling satisfied. At this point I would like to quote my favourite shloka from [Steve's Bhagavat Gita](http://blog.techapj.com/steve-bhagavat-gita), which keeps me motivated everyday.

> Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven’t found it yet, keep looking. Don’t settle. As with all matters of the heart, you’ll know when you find it.

I do believe that what we are doing at Discourse is a great work, and I love doing it! I am not a [Magpie Developer](http://blog.techapj.com/coding-pleasure) anymore, and I feel blessed to be in Discourse team.

I would really like to Thank each and every one in Discourse team for being like a brother to me, and especially my coach Jeff Atwood, for believing in me.
